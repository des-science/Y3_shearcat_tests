# Some info on the scripts used for measuring xi+/-

1. call_xipm_xcorrmod_binslop0_apr4highsnr.py calls the script (it's very short)
2. xipm_xcorrmod_binslop0_apr4highsnr.py is the main script with classes to set up the measurement (it's a mess because I've modified things in a terrible way)
3. info_bslop0_apr4highsnr.py is also necessary and sets up some of the paths and parameters such as the mastercat path, theta bins, etc.
4. destest_mcal_highsnr.yaml is called from xipm_xcorrmod_binslop0_apr4highsnr.py (see mcal_file = ...)

Apologies that a lot of the stuff/settings in these above files are not used.
It's exactly because things are a bit obfuscated that there is probably an issue now...

UPDATE: Sep 13, 2020

Final script for measuring xi+/- is "Y3KP_xipm_forcosebis_script.py"
which also needs "cats_cosebis.yaml" and destest/treecorr

Things that are hard-coded that need to be updated:
--out_ascii output name at very end of the script; an ascii file is needed
for the rest of the COSEBIs pipeline.
--The call to corr.process(cat_s, num_threads=40) probably needs num_threads
removed or updated to whatever threads your machine uses.
--datafile path to catalog at top of cats_cosebis.yaml

The rest should be ok, but good to double-check everything looks as it should.
The script is fairly short since there's no tomographic binning.

`python Y3KP_xipm_forcosebis_script.py` runs it!
